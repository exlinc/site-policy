Thank you for using EXL Inc-owned services! We're happy you're here. Please read this Terms of Service agreement carefully before accessing or using EXL Inc-owned services. Because it is such an important contract between us and our users, we have tried to make it as clear as possible. For your convenience, we have presented these terms in a short non-binding summary followed by the full legal terms.

### The EXL Inc. Terms of Service

Effective date: May 25, 2018

### A. Definitions

**Short version:** _We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information._

1.  The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the EXL Inc. Privacy Statement, available at [exlinc.com/legal](https://exlinc.com/legal#privacy-statement)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [exlinc.com/legal](https://exlinc.com/legal).
2.  The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by EXL Inc.
3.  The “Website” refers to EXL Inc.’s website located at [exlinc.com](https://exlinc.com/), [exlskills.com](https://exlskills.com/), [exlcode.com](https://exlcode.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by EXL Inc. at or through the Website. It also refers to EXL Inc.-owned subdomains of the aforementioned sites, such as [accounts.exlinc.com](https://accounts.exlinc.com). These Terms also govern EXL Inc.’s other web sites. Occasionally, websites owned by EXL Inc. may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.
4.  “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
5.  “EXL Inc.,” “We,” and “Us” refer to EXL Inc., Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6.  “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
7.  An "Account" represents your legal relationship with EXL Inc. A “User Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on EXL Inc-owned websites.

### B. Account Terms

**Short version:** _User Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure._

#### 1. Account Controls

- Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your User Account and the Content within it.

#### 2. Required Information

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#l-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

#### 3. Account Requirements

We have a few simple rules for User Accounts on EXL Inc.'s Service.

- You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
- A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free User Account.
- One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
- You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. EXL Inc. does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#m-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
- Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many User Accounts as your subscription allows.

#### 4. User Account Security

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

- You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
- You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. EXL Inc. cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
- You will promptly [notify EXL Inc.](https://support.exlinc.com) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

#### 5. Additional Terms

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of EXL Inc. For example, you may be a member of an organization on EXL Inc. with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with EXL Inc.; or you may use EXL Inc. to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

### C. Acceptable Use

**Short version:** _EXL Inc. hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other._

#### 1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

#### 2. Content Restrictions

You agree that you will not under any circumstances upload, post, host, or transmit any content that:

- is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities;
- is or contains sexually obscene content;
- is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent;
- is discriminatory or abusive toward any individual or group;
- contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system); or
- infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other rights.

#### 3. Conduct Restrictions

While using EXL Inc., you agree that you will not under any circumstances:

- harass, abuse, threaten, or incite violence towards any individual or group, including EXL Inc. employees, officers, and agents, or other EXL Inc. Users;
- use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes;
- attempt to disrupt or tamper with EXL Inc.'s servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on EXL Inc.'s servers through automated means, or to access EXL Inc.'s Service in ways that exceed your authorization;
- impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with EXL Inc., or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site's purpose; or
- violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person's personal information without consent.

#### 4. Services Usage Limits

You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without EXL Inc.'s express written permission.

#### 5. Scraping

Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through EXL Inc.'s API. Please see [Section H](#h-api-terms) for our API Terms. You may scrape the website for the following reasons:

- Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from EXL Inc. for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access.
- Archivists may scrape EXL Inc. for public data for archival purposes.

You may not scrape EXL Inc. for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling EXL Inc. users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of EXL Inc. data gathered through scraping must comply with the [EXL Inc. Privacy Statement](https://exlinc.com/legal#privacy-statement).

#### 6. Privacy

Misuse of EXL Inc. Users' Personal Information is prohibited.

Any person, entity, or service collecting data from EXL Inc. must comply with the [EXL Inc. Privacy Statement](https://exlinc.com/legal#privacy-statement), particularly in regards to the collection of our Users' Personal Information (as defined in the EXL Inc. Privacy Statement). If you collect any EXL Inc. User's Personal Information from EXL Inc., you agree that you will only use the Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from EXL Inc., and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from EXL Inc. or EXL Inc. Users.

#### 7. Excessive Bandwidth Use

If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other EXL Inc. customers, we reserve the right to suspend your Account or throttle your file hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.

#### 8. User Protection

You agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms our Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting our Users as a whole.

### D. Non-courseware, User-Generated Content

**Short version:** _Excluding EXLskills courses, you own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it in perpetuity, so that we can display, analyze, and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to._

#### 1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

#### 2. EXL Inc. May Remove Content

We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any EXL Inc. terms or policies.

#### 3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other EXL Inc. Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting EXL Inc. the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

#### 4. License Grant to Us

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant EXL Inc. the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.

#### 5. License Grant to Other Users

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of EXL Inc. a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the EXL Inc. Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on EXL Inc. as permitted through EXL Inc.'s functionality. You may grant further rights if you adopt a license. If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other EXL Inc. Users.

#### 6. Contributions Under Course License

Whenever you make a contribution to a course containing notice of a license, you license your contribution under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

#### 7. Moral Rights

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant EXL Inc. the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

### F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact our support team [here](https://support.exlinc.com). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on EXL Inc. violates your rights, please contact our support team [here](https://support.exlinc.com). There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.

### G. Intellectual Property Notice

**Short version:** _We own the service and all of our content and courses. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed._

#### 1. EXL Inc.'s Rights to Content

EXL Inc. and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © EXL Inc., Inc. All rights reserved.

### H. API Terms

**Short version:** _You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of EXL Inc.'s APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses EXL Inc-owned APIs_

#### No Abuse or Overuse of the API

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to EXL Inc. via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. EXL Inc., in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed EXL Inc.'s rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from EXL Inc. for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling EXL Inc. users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the EXL Inc. API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [EXL Inc. Privacy Statement](https://exlinc.com/legal#privacy-statement).

EXL Inc. may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of EXL Inc.'s Service.

### K. Advertising on EXL Inc.

**Short version:** _We do not generally prohibit use of EXL Inc. for advertising. However, we expect our users to follow certain limitations, so EXL Inc. does not become a spam haven. No one wants that._

#### 1. EXL Inc. Courses

EXL Inc. courses are intended to host Content. You may include static images, links, and promotional text in the documents associated with your courses, but they must be related to the course hosting on EXL Inc-owned web sites.

You may not advertise in other Users' courses, such as by posting monetized or excessive bulk content in discussions.

#### 2. Spamming and Inappropriate Use of EXL Inc.

Advertising Content, like all Content, must not violate the law or these Terms of Use, for example through excessive bulk activity such as spamming. We reserve the right to remove any advertisements that, in our sole discretion, violate any EXL Inc. terms or policies.

### L. Payment

**Short version:** _You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of EXL Inc-owned services. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change._

#### 1. Pricing

Our pricing and payment terms are available at each services pricing page, for example, for [EXLskills Pricing](https://exlskills.com/pricing) and [EXLcode Pricing](https://exlcode.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term. If you agree to an instructors rate, that will remain your price for the duration of the interaction with that instructor; however, prices are subject to change at the end of an interaction with an instructor.

- You may change your level of service at any time by choosing your plan or going into your billing settings -- on a per-service basis.

Please see our section on [Cancellation](#m-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

#### 3. Metered billing

Interactions with pay-by-usage services, such as instructors on EXLskills.com, may be billed at the rate set prior to the interaction and billed immediately.

#### 4. Billing Schedule; No Refunds

### M. Cancellation and Termination

#### 1. Account Cancellation

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with EXL Inc. You can cancel your Account at any time by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen of the service you wish to cancel. The Account screen provides a simple cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

#### 2. Upon Cancellation

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information can not be recovered once your Account is cancelled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

#### 3. EXL Inc. May Terminate

EXL Inc. has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. EXL Inc. reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

#### 2. Legal Notice to EXL Inc. Must Be in Writing

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any changes that affect your rights and give you time to adjust to them._

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments.
